Bipartite.py, Circulant.py, and MongolianTent.py have been created as classes, and will not run on their own. The Graph.py file allows the user to select which graph to create, and then creates an instance of the corresponding class object based on the user input. Because of this, Bipartite.py, Circulant.py, MongolianTent.py and Graph.py must be downloaded in order to run the program
